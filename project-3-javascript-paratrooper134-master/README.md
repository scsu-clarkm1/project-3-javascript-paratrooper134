# Project 3 - JavaScript

Using this repository as starter code, watch the video at https://youtu.be/duNmhKgtcsI and code along to complete the project. You should only need to modify main.js. It is easier to start with these files rather than the link given in the video.

You may submit your code via Blackboard or GitHub.
